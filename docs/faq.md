# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I run this alongside regular MSYS2?

As it installs to its own location, both can be installed at the same time. However its worth noting the home directory would be shared between the two.

## Can I install additional tools?

Anything available to MSYS2 can also installed to QMK MSYS. For more details, refer to the [MSYS2 documentation](https://www.msys2.org/docs/package-management/).

## How do I keep my environment up to date?

Periodic updates will be available to cover both major MSYS2, and QMK CLI updates. Installing the 
[most recent release](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_distro_msys/releases/latest) will ensure you have the latest requirements to build QMK firmware.

Interim updates have to be performed manually. This can done within the terminal by running the following commands:

```console
# Update the package database and core system packages with:
pacman -Syu  

# If needed, close QMK MSYS, run it again from Start menu. Update the rest with:
pacman -Su

# update QMK CLI
python3 -m pip install qmk --upgrade
```

## How do I configure Windows Terminal?

[Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab), which supports various shells, can also be extended to support QMK MSYS.

In the tab dropdown menu, select `Settings` which opens a code editor showing a JSON configuration file. Insert the example profiles shown below under the profiles key.

Note that the example below assumes that you have QMK MSYS installed to the default location.

```json
"profiles": {
  "list":
  [
    // ...
    {
      "guid": "{1ca2e875-5a87-40f8-b55c-e7ec84354a92}",
      "name": "QMK MSYS2",
      "commandline": "%PROGRAMFILES%/QMK_MSYS/msys2_shell.cmd -defterm -no-start -mingw64",
      "icon": "%PROGRAMFILES%/QMK_MSYS/icon.ico"
    }
```
